B compiler in B

## Road

The `road` folder contains B language examples that are designed to help you implement a compiler.
The examples are more or less sorted by difficulty. By implementing language features one by one
you can move from one example to another. Once your compiler successfully compiles all the files
that means the compiler is complete.

Examples from `000.b` to `029.b` are written in PDP-7 edition of B. Examples from `030.b` to
`039.b` are written in PDP-11 edition of B.

NOTE: The road isn't finished, and not every language feature is represented. But you can still use
the examples to get started.
